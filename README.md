Out late at night without a walking buddy? Scared to walk home alone?

Fear not, SafeWalk is here for you!

With new crimes popping up every day, from small time thefts to aggravated assaults, there was a need for a way to get home safe and sound.

SafeWalk incorporates the EveryBlock and Google Maps API to determine how to get where you want to get in the safest and most efficient way. SafeWalk rigorously sorts through possible routes, taking into account places of recent criminal activity and implements waypoints to find the best path for you!

SafeWalk was conceived by a group of 3 sophomores from Penn and a sophomore from MIT.
